## Getting Started

To get started with your Next.js project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then, navigate to your project directory and run:

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    # or
    bun install
    ```

2. **Run the Development Server**: After installing dependencies, start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or
    bun dev
    ```

3. **View the Application**: Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page will auto-update as you edit the file.

This project utilizes [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Features

- **Server-Side Rendering**: Automatically render pages on the server for better SEO and performance.
- **Static Site Generation**: Pre-render pages at build time for improved loading speed.
- **API Routes**: Easily create API endpoints within the Next.js framework.
- **Image Optimization**: Automatically optimize images with the Next.js Image component.
